In this project,aftetr the importing the dataset, the features and labels are separated.
then the dataset is splitted into train and test.
the perceptron model is made and eta values is defined to improve the accuracy.thhen the train dataset in modelled into the perceptron and test data is predicted.
finally the accuracy is calculated and misclassified samples are identified.
